Unrestrict removes the new controversial reporting features introduced by Mojang in 1.19.1

## ðŸª¶ Detailed explanation
Unrestrict came to life when I saw what Mojang addded in 1.19.1: new, reporting features. As everyone else in the community, I found this outrageous, and thus decided to use my Java skills to make a small mod to completely remove this.
Unfortunately, this does not come without any disadvantage. Unrestrict only works on the client side, and I am investigating on how I could make it server-side too, disabling the report system on entire servers. For now, my only hope is to spread this mod and have a good portion of the community install it, essentially making Mojang's reporting features useless, even though it does not remove the trolls, and fake reports..
